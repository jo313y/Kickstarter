# Kickstarter Analysis 1

Your written analysis must contain three sections:

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What are some limitations of this dataset?
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Images can be added with the following syntax: ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png).
Hyperlinks to relevant files are  added in a similar manner: [filename](path/to/filename.xlxs).

##Overview
In order to determine if there is a correlation between launch dates and fundraising goals, data from multiple plays were analyzed. More specific analysis looking for trends between theater launch dates and goals was also performed. A further look into the data to determine if there was a correlation betweeen the fundraising outcome based on the goals of the fundraising compaign was graphed. The data was provided by the client in the Kickstarter data set.  

##Analysis
In order to determine if the launch date of a fundraising campaign affected the outcome, a lineplot of the outcomes throughout each month of the year was created. Further analysis looking more specifically at fundraising campaigns for theaters based on launch date was performed using a line plot as well. To determine if the fundraising goals affected the outcome, a line plot was also created. All of these data analyses utilized pivot tables or specific sorting in order to extract the relevant data. 

##Results

**Launch Date vs Outcome**
